# visualizing_neural_nets
Contains visualizations for common neural network building blocks like Multi Layer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks.

## Intro
Visualizing the parameters, activations, and gradients can help give us a good idea of how are models are working as well as make it easy to identify bugs. This repo contains simple demos of popular datasets including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, and the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. Each notebook contains simple neural net models as well as code to create useful plots.
